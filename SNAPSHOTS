1. You need to have lz4 installed in order to extract the snapshot.
```sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd -y
sudo snap install lz4```

2. Begin by stopping the Initia node so that we can replace the node data with the snapshot.
```sudo service initia stop```

3. Now we create a backup of the ‘priv_validator_state.json’ file, for a validator node this is critical as it indicates the last block you signed.
```cp $HOME/.initia/data/priv_validator_state.json $HOME/.initia/priv_validator_state.json.backup```

4. Make a backup of the data. We will restore this from our snapshot.
```mv $HOME/.initia/data $HOME/.initia/data_bk ```

5. We can now download the snapshot and its contents
```curl -L http://snapshots.staking4all.org/testnet-snapshots/initia/latest/initia.tar.lz4 | lz4 -dc - | tar -xf - -C $HOME/.initia```

6. Now, it's crucial to reinsert the 'priv_validator_state.json' file to its original location to prevent the node from attempting to sign blocks that have already been signed.
```cp $HOME/.initia/priv_validator_state.json.backup $HOME/.initia/data/priv_validator_state.json```

7. You can now start your node.
```sudo service initia start
sudo service initia status
sudo journalctl -u initia -f```


8. You can now remove the backup data, if for some reason it did not work you can revert to your original state by placing the content back.
``` rm -r $HOME/.initia/data_bk 
rm $HOME/.initia/priv_validator_state.json.backup```
